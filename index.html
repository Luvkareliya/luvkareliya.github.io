<p1>Scientific method is a proposed system of understanding a natural phenomenon by establishing knowledge.There are basically three main parts of the scientific method, Evidence, hypothesis and theory. Imagining something is easy, but practically observing something in nature and collecting evidence of that is a tough job. Collecting evidence means showing that what you observed really occurred and is not ‘fictional’. Evidence can be gathered by experiments or direct observation. After gathering handful of evidence, you’ll need to propose an idea which will explain why that particular natural phenomenon is occurring, and that is called a hypothesis. It consists of explaining the phenomenon with respect to your calculations and observation. When your hypothesis is widely accepted and is mathematically correct, then it’s a theory. A theory explains everything of that phenomenon supported by the experiments and observation.</p1>
