<h1>It's me, <strong>Luv</strong></h1>
<h2>And my <b>story</b>

<body>
<p>Hi! <b>Luv</b> here, I’m a teenager in Grade 10, and welcome to my website! I’m the kind of guy who likes to be relatively more hyper than other, like in everything. Some people say that it is rude and ill-mannered but I simply don’t care.  I just love to play, enjoy and break things. I have a wonderful group of friends which are like me too, actually it’s a <i>gang</i>! <big>Chomepion Sweg</big>, that’s the name we gave it, it has a <i>‘home’</i> and a <i>‘we’</i> which means that when ‘<i>we</i>’ are together it feels like ’<i>home</i>’. We’ve been together for 7 months and I’m probably the only guy who remembers that. This gang really means a lot to me… when I was new in the school I never use to talk to anyone, I just didn’t find anyone like me, every night I use to cry a lot because I was too disappointed with myself, I didn’t knew what to do… then one day, a guy named <b>Kabir</b> walks to me and introduces himself, I did the same, we became friend very quickly, like really fast and I guess that’s because we both were a huge fan of Carryminati,  Kabir is really a nice guy, he’s loyal and trustworthy but he’s discriminated lot because of his academic performance, but I never treated him that way and that’s why he considers me his best friend. As soon as I and Kabir became friends, I got to know some other ‘my type’ guys, <b>Aman</b>, <b>Nirbhay</b>, and <b>Mokshaj</b>. I always used to hang out with them and not talk to anyone else, I just didn’t feel the need to. I started to become happy and more of myself.</p>
<p> After the first semester, <b>Arjun</b> started hanging out with us because his previous group betrayed him and he thought that we were the most united group ever, and he was like us too. And then we decided to make an official gang on 20 December, 2018, <strong>The Chomepion Sweg!!!</strong> And now everything is settled, everyone is happy and we kept our reputation of messing things up. I think <ins>these friends are the best ones I can get in my life.</ins></p>
