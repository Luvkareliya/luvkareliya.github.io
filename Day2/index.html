           <p>As mentioned before, I made a design of a motor holder and 3D printed it.</p>
           <img src="images/image2.png" alt="" class="center"/>
           <p>This was my initial idea, to create clamps which would hold the stepper motor. But my design was flawed, and thatâ€™s because of two reasons: 1) the circumference of the base was not exactly similar to the motor's circumference. 2) the clamps were too thin, two of them broke apart as I tried to place the motor inside it.</p>
           <p>I was left with no option but to use a glue gun and fix the motor on the base.</p>
           <img src="images/image1.png" alt="" class="center" />
           <p>This was my first failure in this project. After attaching the holder to the mount, I started working on Arduino and learned the mechanism of unipolar stepper motors.</p>

           <p>After a couple of hours of learning Arduino sketches of stepper motors and finally getting to code and upload it, I found out another fault in the system. My motors would work fine and the mount was rotating as expected, but when I attached the optical tube to it, it stopped working. My 28BYJ-48 DC unipolar stepper motor was lacking torque.</p>
