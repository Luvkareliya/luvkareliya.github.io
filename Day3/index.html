        <p> My stepper motors werenâ€™t working due to low  torque so I had to switch to Servo motors. Servo motors are very precise but most of them turn only 180 degrees. But luckily I had access to Tower Pro MG995. Those can rotate completely and are called 360 Servos.</p>

        <p>After spending an hour in understanding how servos work and their codes, I started ideating on how I would attach this motor to the Azimuth mount. It took some time to come up with a design of another motor holder. </p>

        <p>After 3D printing my holder, I had to attach the motor to it, which went well. But there was a fault in my design, my defined parameters of the distance between the motor and the mount were much larger than actual ones.</p>
        <img src="images/image1.png" alt="" class="center"/>
        <p>After this, I decided to make another gear instead of designing another holder, which went well and at the end the Azimuth mount was working!</p>
